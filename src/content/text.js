export const aboutSteve = `My name is Steve Yungen and I live in Central Point, Oregon. I like to write songs, sing and play guitar, bass and lapsteel. My favorite types of music are Hawaiian Slack Key guitar, Rock’n’Roll, and I also enjoy gospel and choral music.
I’ve played music for many years and started my first band in high school called “Zero and the Slicks”, which focused on doo-wop and car-tragedy love songs. I later played with the Generic Band, which entered and won the state True Value Showdown in 1986.   
I began playing Hawaiian Slack Key guitar styles, which led to playing bass guitar in the Lei Aloha Serenaders, a hula dance band that played for hula dancers in Halau Hula Na Pua O Hawaii Nei.
Most recently, I’ve become interested and involved in songwriting and recording, and I am active in the Southern Oregon Songwriters Association.
I’m a good sideman and can play several instruments and many styles. I play well with others, but am also available for solo performances.`;

export const aboutMusic = `Music has been in my life thanks to my mother and father. There was
always music in my home, either with singing or just music on
records or the radio. Dad liked big band music and quirky, novelty
music, from performers such as Spike Jones and Stan Freberg. Mom
loved old time hymns and church choral music with vocal harmonies.`;
